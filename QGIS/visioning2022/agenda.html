### Workshop Overview

1. This workshop is NOT being recorded! <em>fortunately...</em><br><br>
1. Data files https://github.com/ISUEOGTP/Workshops/blob/main/QGIS/visioning2022/data.zip <br><br>
1. Refering to item #1, feel free to ask questions as we proceed. While I have a plan, today is a bit off-the-cuff. In the event that your question is a more complex than we can answer today, we will put it in the parking lot for our next session.

### Installing QGIS ###
To [https://www.qgis.org/en/site/](install QGIS) and click the Green Download Now button. Version 3.22 or above is recommended. Read instructions Mac users!


---

 ### What is QGIS?

From the QGIS website, <br><br>

"QGIS is a user friendly Open Source Geographic Information System (GIS) licensed under the GNU General Public License. <br><br>
QGIS is an official project of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). 
<br><br>
It runs on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, Windows and Android and supports numerous vector, raster, and database formats and functionalities."

### Resources to learn QGIS

There are many online sources for QGIS, but first and foremost is the QGIS documentation.
- https://docs.qgis.org/3.22/en/docs/index.html (stable)
- https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/index.html (latest)

<br><br>        
A list of additional resources: [https://isueogtp.github.io/Workshops/QGIS/files/QGIS_References_and_Resources.pdf](PDF)
        
        Chris will update this later today.

#### Intro to GIS: Raster Data

Aerial imagery and weather radar

#### Intro to GIS: LiDAR Derived Elevation


<img src="tutorials/introGIS/lidar.png" alt="" style="width: 90%;"/>

---

#### Intro to GIS: File formats
There are several GIS file formats, a few common ones include:

- Shapefiles (SHP) *A standard GIS format*
- GeoJSON
- GeoTIFF
- GeoPackage *Common to QGIS and other opensource software*
- CSV
- KML/KMZ
- Geodatabases GDB (commonly used in ESRI products)


Shapefiles are made up of multiple files (green are required)
<img src="tutorials/introGIS/shapefiles.png" alt="" style="width: 80%;"/>

---

#### Intro to GIS: Shapefiles

**.SHP** the main file, contains the shape coordinates: essentially describing all the basic shapes within the file.

**.SHX** an index file, which helps the GIS software to find features more quickly within the main SHP file.

**.DBF** a dbase file that contains all the attribute data for the features found in the .shp and .shx.

**.PRJ** while not required, very desirable. This file contains information on which projection to use when displaying the data.

#### Map Projections

#### Intro to GIS: GeoJSON.io
We will start out by using a program that is not actually a GIS, but is a great helper tool for creating GIS files and learning about attributes and geometry

Please open up https://GeoJSON.io and follow along!

<img src="tutorials/introGIS/geojson.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;"/>

---
#### Intro to GIS: GeoJSON.io

Beware of the order of latitude and longitude!

<img src="tutorials/introGIS/geojson-io.png" alt="" style="width: 100%;"/>

---
#### Simple mapping with GeoJSON.io
        
1. Make a map of points - Save as a CSV and KML file <br><br>
1. Make a map of a route you would take if on a 1-week summer road trip - save as a GeoJson <br><br>
1. Make a map using a triangle to identify the region of Iowa you think has the lowest household median income. Add a square where you think county with the lowest level of high school graduates exists. - Save this as a ShapeFile  <br><br>

#### GeoJSON and GitHub

###  Explore QGIS Interface - Hands on!!!

We will use data provided in the workshop data directory
   https://github.com/ISUEOGTP/Workshops/blob/main/QGIS/visioning2022/data.zip   
        
- Create a Favorite link to the data directory
- Start with a Map of all the States and the Lakes - Colors might be different than what I have!

#### Add Data and Make a Thematic Map

1. Start a new map
1. Add the National/Regional states.shp and lakes.shp files (several weays to do this!)
1. Map Navigation
1. Inspect the layer's attribute (feature) table
1. Select (and info) and Query the map features
1. Add the vacation.shp file
1. Symbolize the map features
1. Query the map features
1. Filter the attribute table

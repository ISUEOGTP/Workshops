Locations for 869 schools were taken from a point coverage created by the Rock Island District of the US Army Corps of Engineers following the floods of 1993.  The coverage includes all schools listed in the "Iowa Educational Directory:  1993-94 School Year" that occur within the scope of the FEMA-Iowa-GIS project.

DESCRIPTION:  Point coverage showing location of schools within the scope of FEMA-Iowa-GIS project.



ABSTRACT:  The schools coverage consists of point locations manually digitized from 1:24K USGS

1993-94 Educational Directory for the Iowa Department of Education.

INTENDED USE OF DATA: This data set is intended to be used to geographically locate schools and provide

necessary information needed to contact these 

schools.



LIMITATIONS OF DATA: The coverage depicts the schools as a single point location.  Frequently a school

consists of more than one structure.  Frequently a school (especially the Community Colleges) consists of

more than one structure.

PROCEDURE USED TO CREATE THE DATA:  The corners of each Quadrangle were used as 

tics.  Tics generated in Lat-Long coordinates.  Tics and points then manually digitized from Quadrangles

assigning a unique label-id to each school.  Digitized Quadrangles were then appended.  The resulting

coveerage was then 

transformed to UTM coordinate system.  The dBase files were converted to comma delimited ascii format and

converted to an Info table.  The Info table and point coverage were then joined with joinitem command

using the label id as the related item.

Title:  Iowa Educational Directory:  1998-99 School Year

Author/Agency:  Iowa Department of Education

Published Date:  1998



Locations for 869 schools were taken from a point coverage created by the Rock Island District of the US Army Corps of Engineers following the floods of 1993.  The coverage includes all schools listed in the "Iowa Educational Directory:  1993-94 School Year" that occur within the scope of the FEMA-Iowa-GIS project.  Following is the metadata for that point coverage:



FILENAME: ia_schools



DOCUMENTATION DATE:May 13, 1994



DATA THEME: SCHOOL



DESCRIPTION:  Point coverage showing location of schools within the scope of FEMA-Iowa-GIS project.



ABSTRACT:  The schools coverage consists of point locations manually digitized from 1:24K USGS

Quadrangles.  Attribute data is derived from dBase III file which is the database equivalent of the

1993-94 Educational Directory for the Iowa Department of Education.



STATUS:  100% complete.



GEOGRAPHIC AREA:  Mississippi, Missouri, Cedar, Des Moines, Iowa, Nishebotna, Sioux and Skunk River

corridors in Iowa.



MAP PROJECTIONS:  UTM zone 15



MAP UNITS: meters



DATUM: NAD27



SOFTWARE VERSION: ARC/INFO v.6.1.1



INTENDED USE OF DATA: This data set is intended to be used to geographically locate schools and provide

necessary information needed to contact these 

schools.



LIMITATIONS OF DATA: The coverage depicts the schools as a single point location.  Frequently a school

consists of more than one structure.  Frequently a school (especially the Community Colleges) consists of

more than one structure.

PROCEDURE USED TO CREATE THE DATA:  The corners of each Quadrangle were used as 

tics.  Tics generated in Lat-Long coordinates.  Tics and points then manually digitized from Quadrangles

assigning a unique label-id to each school.  Digitized Quadrangles were then appended.  The resulting

coveerage was then 

transformed to UTM coordinate system.  The dBase files were converted to comma delimited ascii format and

converted to an Info table.  The Info table and point coverage were then joined with joinitem command

using the label id as the related item.
